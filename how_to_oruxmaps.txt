    - Inside OruxMaps, under MapTweaks one can choose which variant of the profile to visualize.
    - Download the map from https://www.openandromaps.org/en/downloads/europe
    - In theory, one can use the "Install in Orux" function directly from the phone.
      If it does not work, download the map normally, as a zip file and extract it in "oruxmaps/maps".
    - Hit refresh in map men√∫ of the app. the new map should appear.

// Gpx from Komoot to Oruxmaps
    - There is an Chrome extension to download .gpx from Komoot: 
        + log-in.
        + "save" a path.
        + modify it if necessary.
        + the extension should make a button "Download Gpx" appear.
    - Once one has a gpx file, put it on the phone in some folder.
    - Then open it with Oruxmaps to load the gpx-track.

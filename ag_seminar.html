                    <i>Nekrasov's formula for some orbifolds</i><br>
                    Abstract: 
                    Nekrasov's formula computes equivariant K-theoretic DT invariants for Hilbert schemes of points of toric CY3-folds. We extend this to certain global quotient CY3 orbifolds, refining a result of Young to equivariant K-theoretic DT theory and proving a conjecture by Cirafici. Okounkov's proof of Nekrasov's formula combines two techniques. First, the virtual structure sheaves satisfy a certain factorization property, which allows us to simplify the general form of the DT generating series. Secondly, the rigidity principle allows us to determine the remaining unknowns by computing a limit in the equivariant parameters. We will explain these techniques in the case of schemes and describe some of the modifications to make them work for orbifolds.

                    Abstract: In the past three decades some of the most exciting developments in enumerative geometry were inspired by analogies in mathematical physics. After giving you a crash course on how an algebraic geometer should think about (A-model topological) string theory, I will make a proposal for a mathematically rigorous formulation of the so called refined topological string in the framework of equivariant Gromov—Witten theory on Calabi—Yau fivefolds. Moreover, I will present a surprising correspondence between the so called Nekrasov—Shatashvili limit for a local surface K_S and the enumeration of tangents to a smooth anti-canonical curve in S (assuming the latter exist). This is ongoing work with Andrea Brini.<br>

                        Non-density of rational points on algebraic varieties over number fields
                    </i><br>
                        Abstract: Which varieties over a number field should have a potentially dense set of rational points?  

                        A naive guess based on Lang's conjectures was made in the early nineties: a smooth projective variety over a number field which does not dominate a positive-dimensional variety of general type after any etale covering should have a dense set of rational points over some large enough number field. This conjecture is probably false (and the "correct" conjecture was later formulated by Campana). In joint work with Finn Bartsch and Erwan Rousseau we disprove  the natural analogue  of the aforementioned naive conjecture for transcendental-rational points (a notion I will explain in this talk).  In our proof, we develop the theory of moduli spaces of orbifold maps, establish an analogue of Kobayashi-Ochiai's finiteness theorem for dominant maps in Campana's orbifold setting, employ Mori's bend-and-break and ultimately rely on Faltings's finiteness theorem (formerly Mordell's conjecture).

                    <i>The cycle class of the supersingular locus</i><br>
                    Abstract: Deuring gave a formula for the number of supersingular elliptic curves
                    in characteristic p. We generalize this to a formula for the cycle class of the
                    supersingular locus in the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties
                    of given dimension g. The formula determines the class up to a multiple and shows
                    that it lies in the tautological ring. We also give the multiple for g up to 4.

                    <i>Doubly isogenous genus-2 curves over finite fields</i><br>
                    Our main question is the following: Can you tell the difference between two curves defined over a finite field if you only know their zeta functions and the zeta functions of certain covers? This distinguishing problem is partially motivated by a possible strategy for developing a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for factoring polynomials over finite fields due to Kayal and Poonen. Ultimately, this talk is concerned with cases where the distinguishing problem is not solvable due to the existence of "very similar" curves. Specifically, we study a family of genus-2 curves with a dihedral action and show that so-called doubly isogenous pairs of curves are surprisingly common in this family. We also provide an explanation of this phenomena which corrects the naive heuristics. This is joint work with Arul, Booher, Groen, Howe, Li, Matei and Pries.

                    <br>
                    Abstract: Kim, Kresch and Oh defined moduli spaces of unramified stable maps, which are natural generalisations of (compactified) Hurwitz spaces for a target of an arbitrary dimension. Just like Hurwitz spaces, which are smooth irreducible varieties after normalisation, moduli spaces of unramified stable maps are 'better' compactifications than moduli spaces of stable maps. Pandharipande conjectured that unramified Gromov-Witten invariants of a projective threefold are equal to Gopakumar-Vafa (BPS) invariants in the case of Fano classes (classes that intersect negatively with the canonical class) and primitive Calabi-Yau classes (trivial intersection). After a gentle introduction to unramified Gromov-Witten theory, we will discuss a work in progress which aims to prove the conjecture. This provides a geometric construction of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in these cases. The proof is based on a certain wall-crossing technique.

                    </i><br>
                    Abstract:
                    In 2012, Schiffmann and Vasserot considered a Hall algebra type construction on the cohomology of moduli of sheaves supported on points on a plane and used it to prove AGT conjecture. However due to the mysterious nature of the moduli of representations of pre-projective algebra, these algebras are very hard to study and are often highly non trivial. They are conjectured to be the same as Maulik-Okounkov Yangians which has further applications in Quantum Cohomology. In this talk, my goal is to give an introduction to these algebras and explain how one can use tools from Cohomological DT theory to study these algebras. In particular, I will explain how for the case of cyclic quiver, this algebra turn out to be a half of the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of matrix differential operators on torus, while its deformation turn out be an explicit integral form of Affine Yangian of gl(n).

                    <i>Periods and o-minimality</i><br>
                    Abstract: Periods are numbers obtained by integrating algebraic
                    differential forms over semi-algebraic domains. The set
                    contains interesting numbers like logarithms of algebraic numbers
                    or the values of the Riemann zeta function at integral points.
                    The linear or algebraic relations between them is a classical
                    topic of transcendence theory.
                    
                    Grothendieck gave a more conceptual interpretation in terms of
                    the pairing between singular and algebraic de Rham cohomology
                    of algebraic varieties over the rationals. This leads to
                    the (wide open) Period Conjecture predicting all relations between periods.
                    
                    Kontsevich and Zagier suggested to extend the theory to
                    the so called exponential periods appearing in the theory of
                    irregular connections. The conceptual part of the story has
                    been worked out by Hien and Fresan-Jossen.
                    
                    In joint work with Johan Commelin an Philipp Habegger
                    we show that all exponential periods can be written as
                    volumes in a certain o-minimal structure. This hints
                    at a deeper connection between periods and o-minimiality.

                    Abstract: In this talk, I will present some invariants of curves in positive characteristic p, such as the p-rank, the a-number, or the Ekedahl-Oort type, and discuss intrinsic ways to define them. The main focus will be on Moonen's definition of Ekedahl-Oort types of smooth curves in terms of Hasse-Witt triples. I will show that we can extend this definition to all stable curves. The description we obtain in this manner enables us to compute the dimensions of certain loci of curves. Finally, I will mention some new examples in characteristics p = 2 and p = 3.<br>

                    Abstract: A projective structure on a compact Riemann surface is an equivalence class of projective atlases, i.e. an equivalence class of coverings by holomorphic coordinate charts such that the transition functions are all Moebius transformations.
                    Any compact Riemann surface admits two canonical projective structures: one coming from uniformization's theorem, and one from Hodge theory. These yield two (different) families of projective structures over the moduli space Mg of compact Riemann surfaces. We wish to compare them and give a characterization of the Hodge theoretic family.

                    Abstract: The classical Deuring correspondence provides a roadmap between supersingular elliptic curves and the maximal orders which are isomorphic to their endomorphism rings. Building on this idea, we add the information of a cyclic subgroup of prime order N to supersingular elliptic curves, and prove a generalisation of the Deuring correspondence for these objects. We also study the resulting ell-isogeny graphs supersingular elliptic curve with level-N structure, and the corresponding graphs in the realm of quaternion algebras. The structure of the supersingular elliptic curve ell-isogeny graph underlies the security of a new cryptographic signature protocol, SQISign, which is proposed to be resistant against both classical and quantum attack.

In this talk I will explain how this criterion can be used to recover Miranda's description of the GIT stability of pencils of plane cubics.

                    <i>Transseries and Hardy Fields</i><br>
                    Abstract: Transseries are formal series involving exp and log. The differential field of transseries is a universal domain for algebraic differential equations with asymptotic side conditions (in analogy with the field of complex numbers being a universal domain for algebraic geometry). I will then apply this to Hardy fields. Until recently there were only very limited ways of extending Hardy fields, but recently we have achieved a more or less complete overview. I will start from scratch and define/explain transseries and Hardy fields, including examples.

                    Abstract: While the Hilbert scheme of points on surfaces is pretty well-understood, the Hilbert scheme over manifolds presents a mixture of pathological and unknown behaviour: our knowledge of their components, singularities and deformation theory is very limited. 

                    After a brief survey we report on a new approach to calculate tautological intersection numbers of geometric subsets which play crucial role in enumerative geometry applications. We present a Chern-Segre-type positivity conjecture for tautological integrals coming from global singularity theory.

                    <i>Koszul factorisations of moduli spaces and invariants</i><br>
                    Abstract: Invariants on moduli spaces are defined to be integrations over the virtual fundamental classes or Euler characteristics of the virtual structure sheaves. Roughly a virtual structure sheaf is a Koszul resolution of the structure sheaf and the virtual fundamental class is its Chern character (multiplied by Todd class).

                    In fact their first algebraic constructions by Li-Tian and Behrend-Fantechi look different. Here we explain these two are the same in a reasonable circumstance. Furthermore, we explain the use of Koszul factorisations rather than Koszul resolutions gives rise to Kiem-Li localisations of Li-Tian and Behrend-Factechi constructions. These are joint works with Bumsig Kim and Bhamidi Sreedhar.

                    We can use these to produce invariants of moduli spaces of stable sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds as explained in the joint work with Richard Thomas.

                    Abstract: The weak and strong Lefschetz properties (WLP and SLP) has been much studied for Artinian  algebras. Codimension two Artinian algebras over a field of characteristic zero have the strong Lefschetz property. It is open whether Artin Gorenstein (AG) algebras of codimension c=3 satisfy the weak or strong Lefschetz properties. Harima, Migliore, Nagel, and Watanabe proved that complete intersection algebras of codimension three satisfy the weak Lefschetz property. For c=4, Gondim showed that WLP always holds for regularity r <= 4 and gives a family where WLP fails for any r >= 7, building on an earlier example of Ikeda of failure for r=5. 
        
                    In this talk we go through an overview of Lefschetz properties over AG algebras and we give some recent results in codimensions 3 and 4. In codimension 4 we explore relations between Lefschetz properties of an AG algebra A and the free resolutions of A. Lefschetz properties of the Milnor algebras of projective hypersurfaces will be discussed.

                    Abstract: I will introduce the notion of semi-tautological systems, which are systems of subalgebras with minimal set of functoriality properties of the cohomology rings of the moduli spaces of stable curves. They are designed to study the structure of the cohomology of the moduli spaces of stable curves beyond the tautological ring.  I will give a criterion for a given semi-tautological system to span all of cohomology in a given degree. Using this criterion and other results about the moduli space of curves, both topological and algebro-geometric, I will give several applications. These applications include a complete description of the thirteenth cohomology of the moduli space of stable n pointed curves of genus g for all g,n and that all cohomology classes of sufficiently high degree are tautological.  This is joint work in progress with Hannah Larson and Sam Payne.

                    This happens in particular if the exceptional curves are torsion in homology.
                    In this talk we will discuss how the classical relationship between topological string theory, enumerative geometry and mirror symmetry generalizes to this setting.

                    Abstract: The supersingular locus is one of main interests in algebraic geometry in characteristic p, and can be described in terms of polarised flag type quotients (PFTQs) in the sense of Li and Oort. The description for g=3 is rather explicit and is exploited by Karemaker and Yobuko and myself for investigating the arithmetic invariants of supersingular abelian threefolds, namely, the endomorphism rings and automorphism groups of them, confirming Oort's conjecture for g=3. In this talk we shall explain a general method for investigating the arithmetic invariants on supersingular EO strata, and report the progress of the joint work with Karemaker for g=4.

The formula is related to a conjectured formula for topological χ_y-genera of Göttsche, and is a refinement of a formula of Vafa-Witten relating to S-duality. I will also discuss the proof of the formula, which is based on the blow-up algorithm of Nakajima-Yoshioka for framed sheaves on ℙ^2.

                    Abstract: Let X be a complex algebraic surface. Let A be a (noncommutative) coherent O_X-algebra whose generic stalk is a central division algebra. Then the pair (X,A) can be thought of as a noncommutative algebraic surface. This talk deals with the moduli space of line bundles on (X,A), i.e., of locally free A-modules of rank one, in the cases where X has Kodaira dimension zero or is Fano. It turns out that the moduli space can be compactified by adding  torsion-free A-modules of rank one. We will study e.g. the smoothness of this compactification and the deformation theory of the sheaves involved. This is partly joint work with U. Stuhler and with N.Hoffmann.

                    <i>Extending torsors via log schemes </i><br>
                    Abstract: We give here an approach of the problem of extending torsors defined on the generic fiber of a family of curves. The question is to extend each of the structural group and the total space of the torsor above the family. This problem has been studied by many researchers, starting by the first ideas of Grothendieck who solved the case of a constant group of order prime to the residual characteristic. When we are interested in algebraic varieties from an arithmetic point of view, it is natural to consider torsors under a finite flat group that is not necessarily constant: we talk about fppf torsors. In fact, we know from the literature that there are cases where the problem does not have a solution in this setting.<br>

                    So the idea is to look for a solution in a larger category, namely the category of logarithmic torsors. We will show in particular that the existence of such an extension amounts to extending group functors and morphisms between them. Then, we will compute the obstruction for the extended log torsor to lift into an fppf one. Finally, we give an example of a computation of an extension of a torsor over a given hyperelliptic curve as an application of our results.

                <br>Abstract: Hodge theory can sometimes be used to identify a moduli space of complex varieties with a complex ball quotient, or an open subset of such a space. I will explain that similar things happen for moduli of real varieties. Real moduli spaces of smooth varieties are often not connected, however - to get a connected moduli space one is led to allow some singularities. It turns out that, very similar to the way in which the connected components of the space of smooth varieties embed into the larger moduli space, real arithmetic ball quotients can be glued together to form a large real ball quotient. Unitary Shimura varieties provide the right framework for this glueing procedure. I will explain how this works, constructing non-arithmetic lattices in PO(n,1) for every n.

We introduce a new "rhizomic" topology on log schemes coarser than the log etale topology. Will this be enough?

                <br>
                Abstract: Logarithmic and orbifold structures provide two different paths to the enumeration of curves with fixed tangencies to a normal crossings divisor. Simple examples demonstrate that the resulting systems of invariants differ, but a more structural explanation of this defect has remained elusive. I will discuss joint work with Luca Battistella and Dhruv Ranganathan, in which we identify birational invariance as the key property distinguishing the two theories. The logarithmic theory is stable under strata blowups of the target, while the orbifold theory is not. By identifying a suitable system of “slope-sensitive” blowups, we define a “limit" orbifold theory and prove that it coincides with the logarithmic theory. Our proof hinges on a technique – rank reduction – for reducing questions about normal crossings divisors to questions about smooth divisors, where the situation is much-better understood.

                <br>
                Abstract: The Jacobian J0(N)  of the modular curve X0(N) has received much attention within arithmetic geometry for its relation with cusp forms and elliptic curves. In particular, the group of Q-rational points on X0(N) controls the cyclic N-isogenies of elliptic curves. A conjecture of Ogg predicted that, for N prime, the torsion of this group comes all from the cusps. The statement was proved by Mazur and later generalised to arbitrary level N into what we call generalised Ogg’s conjecture.
                Consider now the generalised Jacobian J0(N)m with respect to a modulus m.  This algebraic group also seems to be related to the arithmetic of X0(N) through the theory of modular forms. In the talk we will present new results that compute the Q-rational torsion of J0(N) for N an odd integer with respect to a cuspidal modulus m. These generalise previous results of Yamazaki, Yang and Wei. In doing so, we will also discuss how our results relate to generalised Ogg’s conjecture.

                Working over a non-archimedean local field F, we define a natural measure on the F-points of such moduli spaces. We prove that the integral of a certain naturally defined gerbe on the moduli spaces with respect to this measure is independent of the Euler characteristic.
                Analogous statements hold for (meromorphic or not) Higgs bundles.
                Recent results of Maulik-Shen and Kinjo-Coseki imply that these integrals compute the BPS invariants for the del Pezzo case and for Higgs bundles.

                <br>Abstract: The computational complexity class of the existential theory of the reals contains problems which can be reduced to checking whether a system of polynomial equations has a solution over the real numbers. The complexity of a lot of problems in computational geometry turns out to be captured by this class (they are complete for this class). These completeness proofs often use the completeness of a specific Continuous Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CCSP) as an intermediate step. We attempt to give a more systematic analysis of the computational complexity of these CCSPs, and show that a large class of CCSPs is complete for the existential theory of the reals.
                In this talk, I will give a introduction to computational complexity, the existential theory of the reals, and CCSPs. Then I will state our results, and give a sketch of the proof. This talk is based on joint work with Tillmann Miltzow.

                <i>Computing binary curves of genus five</i>
                <br>Abstract. In this talk, we will present algorithms used to determine, up to isomorphism over $\F_2$, all genus five curves defined over $\F_2$ (together with the sizes of their $\F_2$-automorphism groups). Furthermore, we will discuss the outcome considering the Newton polygons of computed curves and mention the obtained stack count $|\mathcal{M}_5(\F_2)|$.
